-Hooks : Hooks are built-in React functions introduced in React version 16.8. They allow you to use features of the React library like lifecycle methods, state, and context in functional components.

-React follows the principle of component-based architecture. A component in React is an isolated and reusable piece of code. The components can be of two types – class components and functional components.

TailwindCSS and Props:

Props : https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beginners-guide-to-props-in-react/

Props simply stands for properties. They are what make components reusable. Because they perform an essential function – they pass data from one component to another.  

Props act as a channel for component communication. Props are passed from parent to child and help your child access properties.

In React, when you are using the useState hook to update the state, there are two common ways to update the state based on the previous state. The difference lies in how they handle asynchronous updates and potential issues with stale state.

1. Using the Previous State Value Directly:
-setCounter(counter + 1);


2. Using the Functional Update Form:
-setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);

//In Js, function have composability: means a function can have a function inside it 

//In ReactJs, components are plian old Js Functions(w.r.t. fucntional components)


//Statefull component : a component which is managing some its own states or interaction with db or apis

//Stateless component:
-In react, a component should have minimum side effects, but in reality we need functionality like on clicking the content should , or fetching the data which are the kind of side-effects.
//So to achieve stateless component , the statefull logic is kept into another functions or another components.That another functions or components is called hooks 
//hooks can be reused 
//for example, side effects code like data fetching , db searching, logging into the console . These logics can be keep into another function(hooks)

✅React hooks are simple fucntions that we can use to separate out the reusable part from a function.It can be stateful and can manage side effects!!
